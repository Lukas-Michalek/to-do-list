# **To Do List**

The aim of this project is to build a simple full-stack to-do list app leveraging the the MVC(Model - View - Cotroller) architecture. This web application will allow users to add a new task to their to-do list. Users will also be able to remove tasks from the list once they have completed them by clicking on the list item. 

**The final application will look like this**
